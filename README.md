# hangouts.js
This is a port of hangups python library by tdryer to a js library, so that it can be used by anyone in their webapps.
The initial attempt is to implement the proprietary hangouts protocol in a webapp with a nodejs server, and then put the methods as exported 
objects in hangouts.js, which can then be used by anyone in their webapps to add a cool hangouts feature :) !
